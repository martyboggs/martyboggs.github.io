this is a test post. I wrote it in order to get an idea of how text lays on the page. The first text I wrote was too short and gave me only a vague sense of how the final blog will look, but I'm confident that with these additional sentences plus [a few code snippets](/), videos and blockquotes I'll have a good example of how this thing will look.

```javascript
function doIt() {
	var settings = {
		big: 'weiner',
		dog: 'that\'s tight'
	};
}
```

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
